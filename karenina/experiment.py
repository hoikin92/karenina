        """Set up an experiment with multiple treatments

        Parameters
        ----------
        treatments -- a list of treatment names. e.g. ['Control','Temperature Stress']
        n_individuals -- a list of the number of individuals in each treatment. e.g. [10,4]
        n_timepoints -- an integer number of timepoints
        individual_base_params -- a default dict with the base parameters (pre-perturbation) to be
          applied to each individual.
        treatment_params -- a list of lists of perturbations to apply to each treatment. The form is a bit
          complex to allow for more powerful specifications of experimental design.  See note below.

        Specifying perturbations:
        Perturbations are specified as a dict with parameters matching a 'Perturbation' object: start,end,params,update_mode representing the
        starting and ending timesteps of the perturbation, the parameters of that perturbation, and how the specified parameters affect the
        individuals pre-existing parameters (e.g. by replacement or addition).  The
        parameters of the perturbation are specified in a nested dict by axis. Mode can be set to "add", "multiply" or "replace"

        So for example:
        set_lambda_low_treatment = {"start":10, "end:"25,"params":{"x":{"lambda":0.005},"mode":"replace"}}
        treatment_names = ["control","destablizing_treatment"]
        treatments = [[],[set_lambda_low_treatment]]
        -- this will specify a two treatment experiment, in which the 'destabilizing treatment

        interindividual_varation -- the amount of starting variation between individuals
